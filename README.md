# Hello 👋

🧑 My name is Bruno Vilar. 

📍 From Portugal

✈️ I'm passionate about traveling, meeting new people and new cultures.

🏄‍♂️ I'm very sociable and mixing hard work with inspiring environments sounds really good to me.

🧑‍💻 I'm always implementing new features and behaviors, not when time runs, but in run time!
